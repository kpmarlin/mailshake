# Mailshake Coding Exercise
Hello there.  Thanks for taking a look at my project.  I took the path less traveled, and drew up an express app *not* using jQuery.  I had a good time getting back into the DOM directly.

## Adding Dependencies
`npm ci` is your friend here.  You'll need to run this prior to running the app.

## Running the App
`npm start` is all you need.  That runs the backend and frontend.

<http://localhost:3000/> is where you'll find the front end.  I used `fetch`, so you're going to want a modern browser that supports it.
